Google Chrome Keyword Finder Extension
======================================

A simple Google Chrome Extension to find a list of keywords on a page.

The options pane allows you to set your list of keywords and parent export bookmark directory (http://i.imgur.com/3o4HB.jpg). 
Once on a page, just click the key icon and it will scan the current url for any of those keywords, highlighting
them in place and showing you a results list in the popover (http://i.imgur.com/JZLFu.jpg).

Download a copy from the github page for now, but it's just a straight-up packed file (read: no autoupdating).
